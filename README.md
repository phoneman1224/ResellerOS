const folders = [
  'backend/routes',
  'backend/controllers',
  'backend/services',
  'backend/models',
  'backend/jobs',
  'frontend/src/components',
  'frontend/src/pages',
  'frontend/src/context',
  'ai/ollama',
  'ai/prompts',
  'ai/nlp',
  'db',
  'scripts',
  'shared',
];

(async () => {
  for (const folder of folders) {
    await fs.ensureDir(path.join(__dirname, folder));
    console.log(`✔ Created: ${folder}`);
  }

  await fs.outputFile('db/schema.sql', '-- SQLite schema file');
  await fs.outputFile('.env', '# Environment variables go here');
  console.log('\n✅ Scaffold complete.');
